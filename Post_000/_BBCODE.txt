[HEADING=1][CENTER]Location and Story[/CENTER][/HEADING]
[CENTER]Welcome to the vibrant [B]Hannan region[/B], where adventure awaits at every turn!
Get ready to embark on an epic quest through arid deserts and lush forests, from the highest peaks to the darkest caves, trainers will be able to visit bustling cities, charming villages and misterious ancient ruins, on the path to the yearly [B]Hannan Pokémon League Tournament[/B]!

In the ancient past a [B]massive meteor shower[/B] hit the region, experts say that one of those falling stars hit what is now approprietly called Mt. Meteor, carving a hole in the mountain and spreading debris all over the region.
Since that day, a [B]mysterious energy[/B] of unknown origin permeates the region; some humans seek to harness this power, while some Pokémon have been sighted glowing and transforming into a much more powerful but uncontrollable state, these have been dubbed [B]Zenith Forms[/B].

The night before starting your Pokémon journey you and your friends [B][COLOR=rgb(65, 168, 95)]Linda[/COLOR][/B] and [B][COLOR=rgb(147, 101, 184)]Oliver [/COLOR][/B]are sitting around a campfire near your hometown, while you all witness a rare sight: [B]3 shooting stars[/B] dash before your eyes and inspire you to race throughout the region to see who will become the next League Champion!

[B][COLOR=rgb(65, 168, 95)]Linda[/COLOR][/B] is a cheerful and easy-going girl who loves to battle and aims to become the strongest trainer ever!

[HEADING=1][CENTER]New Pokémon[/CENTER][/HEADING]

[CENTER]At the start of your journey you’ll meet [B]Chromander[/B], the Adaptable Pokémon!
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/drive-viewer/AEYmBYRzboA5DQwYnLLVVaqnti4ODrqm9kI_1zQ9uZR8JIxHp0gOdoFcjWOnrnrHgw-7HnKbRZDD04d-GAjKT-B4ivgnjhGq=w1080-h1793[/IMG]
This [B]Normal[/B]-type has the unique ability to change its own type and appearance based on its diet, in order to better adapt to new environments.
The Professor is studying this Pokémon and has recently synthesized 3 flavors of candies that are able to turn Chromander into a [B]Grass[/B]-, [B]Fire[/B]- or [B]Water[/B]-type!
[IMG]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/drive-viewer/AEYmBYRr53tqRsDXD2NbclQzO-ExVeSV8ymvP55HR0A91KULEVOH0jzTbPu7NBzwJN8mnJi-BsOkPNtui4Mr3XxwyeY7M78Bzw=w1080-h1793[/IMG]
Chromander is also able to evolve differently depending on its typing, [B]which candy will you choose?[/B]
Meet plenty of other new Pokémon native to the Hannan region and form your dream team!

[HEADING=1][CENTER]Development and Release[/CENTER][/HEADING]

[CENTER]This game is currently being developed (and we’ve been cooking for a while now) with [B]Essentials v19.1[/B].

We are a small friend group from Italy that banded together hoping we can deliver a polished and fun experience from Pokémon fans to other Pokémon fans like you!
We are putting our hearts into every detail while working on Starfall and, even though the game still needs some work, we will try and publish something like a [B]Chapter 1 release as soon as it’s ready and tested[/B].
[/CENTER]
[HR][/HR]
[HEADING=1][CENTER]We want you![/CENTER][/HEADING]

[CENTER]We are currently looking for someone to lend a hand, if you feel like you can help and you would like to join the project, contact us at [U]dev.pkmnstarfall@gmail.com[/U] and be sure to attach a portfolio-like collection of your experience!
We are currently looking for someone to help us work on [B]story [/B]and [B]dialogue [/B]so being a fluent english speaker would help a lot (familiarity with slangs and dialects is welcome).
We would also be interested in working with someone who can produce gen5-style [B]music [/B]for the game.
[B]Some help in the pixel-art department is always welcome![/B]
